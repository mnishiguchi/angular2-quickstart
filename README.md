# Angular 2: Five-minute Quickstart
- My first app with Angular 2 + TypeScript, following [this tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) at https://angular.io/.

## A basic process of writing an Angular 2 app

1. Set up our development environment
2. Write the Angular root component for our app (app/app.component.ts)
3. Bootstrap it to take control of the main web page (app/boot.ts)
4. Write the main page (index.html)
